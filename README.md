- Hi, Iâ€™m @FatLard5826
-
- Iâ€™m interested in coding and creating experiences and games for others to enjoy. I want to eventually get a job as a full-time software developer for a game studio, but I'm currently developing on my own for fun and to see how some of my ideas would work in practice.
- I would like to eventually put some of my projects and ideas on Itch.io/Steam, but for now, my projects are more concepts than actual games.
-
- Iâ€™m currently learning c# and Unity game engine, but I have no experience in modeling, level design, animation, or sound design. I have never made a game on an indie/semi-professional level, and free assets had usually fit well enough for past projects, however, now
- that I am working on something that should eventually be presentable to the public, as well as purchasable and playable, I am finding myself in need of recourses that I am unable to produce with my own skills.
-
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on games that present a unique take on pre-existing genres or try to re-structure a genre altogether to give players new experiences and entertaining gameplay that breaks from the regular monotony of typical Triple-A games. Im currently
- working on a 3d movement shooter based on chaining abilities together for traversal and combat. The game is meant to function like a slower version of ULTRAKILL by NewBlood, or like Shady Knight by Alexey 'cptnsigh', but more focused on giving the player an endless
- number of ways to get from point A to point B, depending on their play style.
- 
- Some of my past works include a 2D platformer project called The Tower, which I designed with a friend in Unity for the Technology Student Association State Competition Video Game Design event, A Digital Casino, able to run blackjack, texas Hold'em, a slot machine, and a number guessing game against a computer player
